	The first consideration when it comes to any visualization is identifying and creating the relationships for the pertinent information.  Thus, to begin this project, I analyzed the datasets given and made considerations on how I was going to model the information when loaded. For instance, I could decide to replicate the nested nature of a JSON file when loading or I could decide to flatten certain portions if it makes maneuvering easier. With this said I decided to flatten the streets.json file in order to get all needed information pertaining to a street in one record.

	After making the decision on the outputs of the loads you can create the connection for your relational tables if they exist. For example, a Company table could have multiple records froim the Employee Table related. Unfortunately, there were no direct connections between any of the datasets. The pumps and streets data were complety separate entities relating objects to placements on the map. While the deathdays and 
I also decided to separate the deathdays.csv into two separate data structures. My reasoning for this is that this table doesn't relate the to deaths_age_sex.csv through a foreign key, thus the 'deaths' column has no need to be attached to 'date' and increases complexity to do so. This separation allowed abstraction on the date slicer. Since I could instead simply allow the slider to be an integer relating to the top selection of deaths, we are wanting from the deaths array. After this process I simply created the data loads and their related variables. 
My rational for design decisions after the data consideration phase mostly stems from lack of knowledge, I am absolutely certain that there are better d3 tactics to relate my visualizations and not to rely on clunky html input sliders. Given this my main concern was drawing all the individual objects based on day and amount of summed deaths. For the map/timeline chart was split into 4 functions: DrawTexts to get all one off text bars in, drawStreets that draws lines based off the streets json, drawPumps draw the pumps on the map in red ellipses, and draw the circles representing deaths. For the circles I also choose to fill in blue for males and pink for females.
