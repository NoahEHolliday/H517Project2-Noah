    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose for the visualization is to create an interactive slicing ability to extract the count of bookings that a particular hotel recieved during the inserted time period. The visualization also gives metrics on average room quality booked/recieved as well as category breakdowns of market sector and hotel type.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The data source for this visualization was gathered from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand. However, it is important to note that multiple alterations were done.</p>
